3. Patient registration form with user-control basic fields (name, age, DOB, address, and slot (morning or evening)) and booking date

4. Appointment Confirmation Notification form (send update to patient dashboard using events and eventhandlers)â€“ user control

5. Patient dashboard with user control that includes the patient's medical records, appointment date, time, and basic information

Important note prior to development


1. The method logic should inherit from the interface class when building the viewModel class.

2. The field name and property should be in the model class (use an IList or other generic collection if necessary).

3. Please utilize observableCollections to store data temporarily.

4. Data should appear in Datagrid or gridView following registration.

3. LINQ can be used for sorting and filtering.

4. Events and Eventhandler should be utilized for providing notifications and changes.
